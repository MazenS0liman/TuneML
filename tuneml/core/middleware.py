Middleware Module
=================

Overview
--------

This module provides FastAPI middleware components for request/response processing,
logging, and context management. Middleware components handle cross-cutting concerns
like request tracking, logging, and context propagation.

Middleware Classes
------------------

:py:class:`RequestLoggingMiddleware`
    Middleware for request ID generation, request/response logging, and processing time tracking.

    Middleware for request ID generation and request/response logging.

    Functionality:
    ==============
    - Generates unique request IDs for tracking requests through the system
    - Logs incoming requests with method, path, and client information
    - Tracks request processing time and logs responses with status codes
    - Stores request ID in request state and context variables for access in handlers
    - Adds request ID to response headers (X-Request-ID) for client correlation
    - Logs errors with timing and exception information if request processing fails

        """
        Process an incoming request and generate logging output.

        Processing Pipeline:
        ====================

        1. **Generate Request ID** - Create unique UUID for request tracking
        2. **Store in Request State** - Make ID accessible in request context
        3. **Set in Context Variable** - Store for cross-context access
        4. **Log Incoming Request** - Record request method, path, and client
        5. **Process Request** - Call next middleware/handler
        6. **Calculate Processing Time** - Measure request duration
        7. **Log Response** - Record status code and timing (success path)
        8. **Add Response Header** - Include X-Request-ID in response headers
        9. **Handle Errors** - Log exceptions and re-raise (error path)

        :type request: Request
        
        :param call_next: Callable to process the request through next middleware

        :returns: Response object with X-Request-ID header
